# SQL (Structured Query Language)  
  is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query,   manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.

  
# Relational database  
  represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables.  
   Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet,   with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

# A query
 is a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned
