# Call stack
  It is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€”  what function is currently being run and what   functions are called from within that function, etc.  

- It's like `LAST IN FIRST OUT `  LEFO

# The key takeaways from the call stack are:
  1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.  
  2. Code execution is synchronous.  
  3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.  


# Types of error messages
  - Reference errors
  - Syntax errors
  - Range errors
