# Javascript Templating
    it is a technique that we use to render client-side view templates in a fast and efficient way

#  Flexbox
   - how we can make a container flex with its children ?  
    
     ``` 
        .container {
        display: flex;} 

     ```

   - how we can control the flex direction ? 
     1. row (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl  
     2. row-reverse: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl  
     3. column: same as row but top to bottom  
     4. column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top     
     for example :  

     ``` 
      .container {
       flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
        }

     ```
