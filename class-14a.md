# Transitions & Animations 
   making a transition on an element means that the status of this element must change to a different syle and we can determin it using :
   * ``` :hover ```
   * ``` :focus ```
   * ``` :active ```
   * ``` :target ```

   we use the animation when we want to do some actions on the element like moving it to more than one place
