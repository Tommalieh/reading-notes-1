# Layout 
 CSS allows as to control the layout of page and ther is  positioning schemes to use :
 1. normal flow ``` position:static ```
 2. relative positioning  ``` position:relative ```
 3. absolute positioning ``` position:absolute ```
 4. fixed positioning ``` position:fixed ```
 5. floating elements using :
    - z-index  
    - float

### screen size 
 every website can be accesed by different devices like _smart phones_  , _laptops_ , _tablets_ , etc 
 and every device have a different screen size and this is maybe a problem for designing a web page , but the css has the solution for that using the different Layouts  like :
 - fixed width Layouts
 - Liquid Layouts

### Multiple style sheets 
 If we need to use more than one style sheet on our webpages  :
     + either we import it ``` @import url("style.css");  ```
     + or we link it ```  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"    href="css/site.css" />  ```
