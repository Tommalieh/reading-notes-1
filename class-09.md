# Form 
  at the last labs when we want some data from the users we used ``` prompt ```
  but this way is not a good way to take data from the users , So we have to use Forms insted 

  ### Form controls

        - text area
        - password input 
    2. Making choices :
        - radio button 
        - checkboxes 
        - drop down boxes
    3. Submitting form 
        - submit buttons 
        - image buttons 
    4. Uploding Files 
        
  ### Steps of form working :
    
    1. the user fills the form and pressess the submitt button 
    2. the values that was writen with the names will be sent to the server 
    3. the server will proccess based on these data 
    4. the server will tell you that it based the data

    - disc
    - lower-alpha 
    - lower-roman

    - padding
    - text-transform 
    - letter-spacing, font-size 
    - border-top, border-bottom 
    - text-align 
    - :hover
