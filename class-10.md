# Error Handling & Debugging 
  - ORDER OF EXECUTION :
     this will help us to know how our script are processed so we can find the order that causes the error 
  - EXECUTION CONTEXTS
     the execution for the content on java scipt debends if the content was:
       1. global content 
       2. function content (local)

  ### There is a different type of object errors like :
     1. Error 
     2. Syntax error 
     3. Reference error
     4. Type error
     5. Range error
     6. URL error
     7. Eval Error 

   so when we should deal with these errors :
     - first we have to  DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS
     - then we HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY  and most time we use try ,catch and finally to handel errors , and its like _try_ this code and if it has an issue _catch_ the other code so each one has its own code block
