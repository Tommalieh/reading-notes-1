# Images 
  when we want to add an image in our webpage we should use this html tag ``` <img src="url" alt="alternativ" /> ```

  and if we want to change the style of an image using css :
   - for size 

        ``` 
         img {
             height : ;
             width : ;
         }
        ```
  - for aligning

        ``` 
            img.align-left {
            float: left;
            margin-right: 10px;
         } 
        ```
   - use an image as a background for p 

        ``` 
         p {
              background-image: url("images/pattern.gif");

           }
        ```
# Practical Information
   + when anyone search using the search engine there is some key places where we should put the words that people might search on to find the site that the search engine will search for it first :
      1. page title 
      2. url/ web address
      3. heading 
      4. text 
      5. link text 
      6. image alt text
      7. page describtions
      
   + when we put our site on the web we should have a domain name and a web hosting and its a good thing to use some Google Analystics to let you see how many people visit the site and their movment on it 
   + thers is a FTP program that allows us to transfer files from the local computer to the web server
