#  Classes, Inheritance, Functions

## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development  
   1. Reduced the Bugs 
   2. Development costs are cut and it Saves the Time 
   3. Supports a clean interface  


## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?  
  I think we should use them before and after we call a function   


## What is one downside of Test Driven Development  
  Its that to make the Test Driven Development in a proper way and to have all its advantages  
  you will fail a lot before you succeed  


## What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?  
  I noticed that the classes are way easier to deal with  
  especially when we want to inherit classes  
  and they are more understandable than the Constructor/Prototype  
  
  
## Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves  
  All the Array methods are a Higher Order function like   forEach and reduce .. etc and they solve the iteration on the array elements in different ways 




### Vocabulary Terms   

| Terms                      | Def           | 
| -------------------------- |:-------------:|
| functional programming     |  is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects|
| pure function              | is a function which Given the same inputs, always returns the same output, and Has no side-effects|
| higher-order function      | is any function which takes a function as an argument, returns a function, or both. |
| immutable state            | Immutable data cannot change its structure or the data in it.
| Objects                    | are complex and each object may contain any combination of the primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.and objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. |
| (OOP)                      | Object-oriented programming (OOP): is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.  |
| class                      | is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects  |
| prototype                  |  is a property can be used to add methods to existing constructors |
| super                      | a keyword used to access and call functions on an object's parent. When used in a constructor, the super keyword appears alone and must be used before the this keyword is used.     |
| inheritance                | is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object    |
| constructor                | In class-based object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special type of subroutine called to create an object.    |
| instance                   | instance: In object-oriented programming (OOP), an instance is a concrete occurrence of any object, existing usually during the runtime of a computer program.    |
| context                    |  Context is always the value of the this keyword which is a reference to the object that “owns” the currently executing code or the function where it’s looked at.    |
| this                       |  A property of an execution context (global, function or eval) that, in non–strict mode, is always a reference to an object and in strict mode can be any value.    |
|(TDD)                       | is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, so its an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring.    |
| Jest                       |  is a JavaScript Testing Framework    |
| Continuous Integration(CI) | is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day    |
| unit test                  |  is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested.The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.    |
