# Express Routing
  
  - Routing means how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

  - we define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example:  
    - app.get() to handle GET requests  
    - app.post() to handle POST requests.  



# Route paths 
 combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made.  
 It can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.


# Express 4.0 :
  the new routs that comes with Express 4.0 like a mini express application.  
  It doesn't bring in views or settings, but provides us with the routing APIs like .use , .get , .param , and route.
