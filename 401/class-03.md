# Data Modeling & NoSQL Databases

## Why would a developer choose to make data models?  
  because it have a lot of advantages like :  
  - Provide very efficient "High-speed" retrieval.
  - Ability to handle more relationship types.
  - Ease of data access.
  - Data Integrity.
  - Data Independence.  


## What purpose do CRUD operations serve?  
  the CRUD word reverse to :  
  - C -> CREATE  
  - R -> READ  
  - U -> UPDATE  
  - D -> DELETE  
  we use them to work on te tables and the define the relational tables  


## What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?  
  1. Postgres : relational database management system (RDBMS)  
  2. MongoDB : NoSQL database program  


## What is Mongoose and why do we need it?  
  is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js.    
  It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation,  
  and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB  



### Vocabulary Terms   

| Terms                      | Def           | 
| -------------------------- |:-------------:|
| database                   | organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.|
| data model                 | is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities. |
| CRUD                       | create, read, update, and delete are the four basic functions of persistent storage |
| schema                     | schema of a database is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system.|
| (SQL)                      | Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system|
| Non SQL (NoSQL)            | a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. |
| MongoDB                    | cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program  |
| Mongoose                   | pending connection to the test database running on localhost|
| record                     | a group of related data held within the same structure    |
| (ORM)                      | Object Relation Mapping : in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language|
