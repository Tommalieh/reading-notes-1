  We know that every website has images inside it 
   + maybe as a logo 
   + or just photograph 
   + diagram
   + background

  so if we want to add image to our webpage we using html tag we use :
    
    ``` 
      <img src="image url.jpg" alt="the alternative for the photo" title=" /> 
    ```
  we can also put attribets for the img :
     - Height 
     - Width
